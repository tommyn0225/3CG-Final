3CG - Mythic Clash - CMPM121 Spr25- Tommy Nguyen

Programming Patterns:

Update Method. Continuously updates game state and frames. Used for input handling
State Pattern. States allow for easy input handling (dragging variable)
Prototype. Card and Pile objects. This pattern provides easy way to group objects with similar properties.
Observer. The game

Feedback From:

Marcus: said the game plays well with all features working. The suggestions he had for me included to consider separating refactoring my ablity functions more. He suggested abstracting some of the abilities. This way the code is easier to read and reusable. He also pointed out that I left some things from my debug mode on such as the ability to see what cards are in the enemy's hand.

Brian: said that the game works well and also suggested the same things as Andy. He also suggested to add some visual clarity to some of the abilities as well as its effects. This way players can easily see what happened and what values were affected. 

Kyle: enjoyed playtesting my game and said everything works well. He critiqued the visual clarity of the game as some things can be lost in translation. He also pointed out that having to constantly click next can sort of make the game feel slow but that is a preference thing.

FROM PROJECT 3:
Postmortem: I think I did well on mimicking the features present in Google's Solitaire hard mode. I struggled a lot on figuring out how to get the cards to only be placed down on valid play spots. If I were to do this again, I'd make a nicer UI.

For final project, refer to Postmortem.pdf

GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS/CHANGES:

- you can discard cards from your hand to free up space (1 card per turn)
    there are some cards that have abilities that depend on discard. The project instructions
    don't really detail much about how cards are discarded so I'm taking some creative liberties.

- added seperate debug mode for extensive testing purposes
